## Reflection

<p id="essay"> 
My second work is a section of notes from my sophomore AP European History class with Mrs. Giffin. This was one of the first notes assignments that I have ever had in high school, even though it was my second year of High School. This is probably because this was the first time we had been instructed to take notes from a textbook and during virtual learning everything was in the form of slides. In this assignment, I put way too much detail into my notes. I wrote too much about details that were way too specific on certain people and topics and I added random data that wouldn’t be important for the AP exam at all. For example, in these notes,  I talked too much about what the important people did in life before they became important instead of talking about their importance and why that impacted the rest of Europe or their society. I also mention some people that are irrelevant to the series of events that we need to know and even when I did mention important people or events, I was too wordy. I could’ve summarized the main points in a few words behind one bullet point instead of writing full sentences describing what the people did and how that impacted their societies. I could’ve definitely summarized my notes more and to a better extent. I could have only focused on the important points of what the textbook was trying to teach us and not focus on those points that are irrelevant to the AP exam. This would have saved me time and effort, as well as allowed me to get more hours of sleep every night instead of spending until 2 in the morning every night doing notes. Overall, this class has taught me how I can more efficiently take notes while still gathering information that I need to know. Towards the end of the class I was able to cut the notes length almost in half because I realized that we didn’t need to go into so much detail with the bullet points. This occurred through looking at others notes, comparing, and seeing how I could better the understanding of notes while also keeping them short. This knowledge of how we should take notes efficiently has followed me through every other class, as I have been able to cut down on the amount of notes drastically from middle school. Having these skills will also be very beneficial as I go into college, where notetaking will be very important to me as I need to capture information from lectures and textbooks in order to learn the material and study for tests. Even though I wasn’t perfect the first time around, as shown with my AP European History notes, I have improved and will continue using these skills in the future.
