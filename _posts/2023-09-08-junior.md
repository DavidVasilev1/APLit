## Reflection

<p id="essay"> 
My third work is my Scrum Boards from my AP Computer Science Principles class with Mr. Mortensen. A Scrum Board is a way to organize tasks and objectives for a project. This usually aligns with the Agile methodology, which is a process used by programmers when developing software. In the very beginning of AP CSP, I was very new to all of this new terminology and methodology that came with development and how to structure my workflows. I also had problems with how the team was organized, as people’s roles were getting mixed up and some people weren’t doing all of the work they had to do. In the example that I proved, you can see how my Scrum board has very little documentation and only has the default sections in order to organize the tracks by status. It also only contains some documentation from the first and second week and one from the very last task we completed. As a result of this I didn’t get a very good score on this project, however I did see ways to improve. I figured out how to better use the organizational tool and I also learned how to use the methodology to progress as a team and iterate through different versions of code. Towards the end of the year I had figured out how to use timelines and I also learned to document every step of the project in the Scrum boards in order to stay organized. I also learned how to customize how the Scrum board was organized and also added dates so that the group had deadlines and milestones to work towards. I also added tags to organize the different documentation types and make it clear where bugs were in the program and how urgent it was to fix them. Overall, through this assignment, I learned to stay organized and also organize group projects better. I have learned how to set realistic goals that are aiming to work towards an end goal that is feasible in the time that is given. I have also learned how to distribute my work across the time given and not procrastinating an assignment until the very last day. In other classes, such as Calculus and English, I have stopped putting work back for later and instead I have worked on it in class to complete it so that I have time for other classes, instead of rushing to complete it right before the deadline. This has also helped me get more sleep as not procrastinating led me to finish my work earlier and not have to stay up until midnight working on assignments that are due the next day. Being able to enhance my organizational skills has allowed me to become a better leader in class projects and distribute my work evenly, even if I initially wasn’t very good at being organized.
